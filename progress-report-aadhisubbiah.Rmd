```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

The first issue I had was that I was trying to work with a table instead of a dataframe. I first had to convert the table from the web-scraping to a dataframe in order to begin cleaning and joining things. 

I then edited the scraped data to better be suited for joining by changing variable types and column names, as well as adding a year column. 

I then pulled playerIDs from the People data set in order to set up the final joing with the existing HOF dataset. 

I finally converted it into a csv file.
